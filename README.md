# Holidaze
Holidaze is an accommodation booking platform built as Project Exam 2 for the Front-End Development program at Noroff.
The project focuses on building a modern, responsive front end that integrates with an existing API.

The application includes both:

- a customer-facing booking experience
- an admin / venue manager interface for managing venues and bookings

# Project Brief

Holidaze is a newly launched accommodation booking service that required a complete front-end solution.
The design and UX were left open, allowing for full creative and technical freedom while meeting a set of functional requirements.

All backend functionality is handled by an existing API. This project covers front-end development only.
